            <h5>Feedback on Flow-1</h5>
            <p>I think the increase in difficulty, from 2.semester to 3.semester is very welcoming. The level of difficulty is very pleasing and it is fun to be pushed.</p>
            <p>Generally the structure of Flow-1 has been very good, what needs to be prepared for each day is clear, as well as what is suppose to be accomplished within a given week. This goes for the
             different assignments, the assignments are well described and clear to follow</p>
            <p>The introduction of Zoom is also very welcoming, as someone living far from the school it is a great setup for remote reviews.</p>
